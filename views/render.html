    <p>{{inputs.mans_name}} is a normal {{inputs.occupation}}.  Then, one day, a {{inputs.noun1}} explodes, causing a {{inputs.noun2}} to blow up, and a nearby {{inputs.noun3}} erupts into a {{inputs.shape}} of flames.</p>
    <p>{{inputs.mans_name}} realizes that he's being chased by the government, who's trying to {{inputs.verb1}} him.</p>
    <p>While on the run, he teams up with an incredibly attractive woman named {{inputs.womans_name}}, who has an incredible {{inputs.body_part}}.</p>
    <p>She may be from the streets, but she can {{inputs.verb2}} like nobody's business.</p>
    <p>The duo decide to turn the tables on their purseuers by blowing up a {{inputs.noun4}}, which triggers a chain reaction, causing the local {{inputs.noun5}}, {{inputs.restaurant_name}}, and the {{inputs.historic_monument}} to explode.</p>
    <p>Then, the bad guys' helicopter gets {{inputs.verb3}} by a piece of {{inputs.noun6}} from when the {{inputs.noun7}} exploded, and the helicopter explodes and falls onto a {{inputs.noun8}}, causing it to {{inputs.verb4}}, which shoots a fireball straight into the heart of {{inputs.noun9}} and destroys the bad guy leader.</p>
    <p>Everything is {{inputs.adjective1}} and the two decide that such a {{inputs.adjective2}} ordeal has caused them to fall in {{inputs.emotion}} with each other.</p>
    <p>They decide to celebrate by {{inputs.verb5}}ing on the {{inputs.noun10}}, and they even managed to use a {{inputs.noun11}} from the beginning of the movie, to {{inputs.verb6}}</p>
